// lib/constants.js — SEASON 2 UPDATE (FIXED RATES — live pricing removed)
//
// ⚠️ Per admin's instruction, the live TON price system was removed — it
// would sometimes overpay users in TON when the market price dipped. Now
// it's back to simple, predetermined (fixed) rates — predictable payouts,
// no dependency on an external API.
//
// Dropped the two-tier Gold + Diamond currency — now there's a single
// currency: the GM coin coin. All reward/fee/withdraw numbers live here.

// ── GM coin → real-money conversion rate (FIXED) ──
export const WTC_PER_USD = 50000; // 50,000 GM coin = 1 USD

// ── The Extract tab's ad-network buttons — each pays GM coin directly ──
// adsgramSpecial re-added (was removed entirely per an earlier
// admin request; now back per a newer request). Different block ID this
// time (27566, daily limit 10) than the old one that was removed. USL Ads was removed entirely (admin request, 12 Oct 2026).
// See api/earn.js's handleAdStart/handleClaimAdReward, which check
// `enabled !== false` before allowing adStart/claimAdReward — kept in
// place so any network can be paused instantly by flipping its `enabled`
// flag here, without a code deploy.
// monetag reward 15 → 10 GM coin (per admin request — Monetag's
// CPM runs low compared to the other networks, so the payout no longer
// matched what it was actually worth).
//
// AD_MIN_WATCH_SECONDS below used to be one shared floor for every network.
// Split into per-network `minWatchSeconds` here instead, since real ad unit
// durations differ network to network — a single shared number was always
// either too strict for the shortest network or too loose for the longest.
// AD_MIN_WATCH_SECONDS still exists as the fallback for any network that
// doesn't set its own minWatchSeconds (see handleClaimAdReward, api/earn.js).
//
// `requiresClick: true` (giga only now) — IMPORTANT — this flag is NOT yet
// enforced anywhere in api/earn.js. Implementing a real click requirement
// needs to be checked against what GigaPub's own SDK actually exposes
// (their simple rewarded-ad call doesn't appear to distinguish click vs.
// impression — only their separate, bigger "OfferWall" product does, which
// is a different integration entirely — see chat history). Flagging it here
// as a marker of INTENT so it isn't forgotten, not as something active.
//
// ⚠️ REMOVED (this update) — Monetag's server-to-server postback system
// (was handleMonetagPostback in api/earn.js, plus the ymid plumbing in
// index.html). Admin decision: reverted back to the same signed-token +
// timer heuristic every other network uses here, at a 6-second floor.

// `requiresClick`, no postback, no ymid, no MONETAG_POSTBACK_SECRET needed.
