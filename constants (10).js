// lib/constants.js — SEASON 2 UPDATE (FIXED RATES — live pricing removed)
//
// ⚠️ Per admin's instruction, the live TON price system was removed — it
// would sometimes overpay users in TON when the market price dipped. Now
// it's back to simple, predetermined (fixed) rates — predictable payouts,
// no dependency on an external API.
//
// Dropped the two-tier Gold + Diamond currency — now there's a single
// currency: the WTC coin. All reward/fee/withdraw numbers live here.

// ── WTC → real-money conversion rate (FIXED) ──
export const WTC_PER_USD = 50000; // 50,000 WTC = 1 USD

// ── WTC earned by watching videos (via the floating "lootbox" button in the video section) ──

export const LOOTBOX_CLAIM_MIN = 25;         // minimum accrued amount required to claim (20 Oct 2026 admin: lootbox can be claimed as soon as it holds 25 WTC)
export const LOOTBOX_CLAIM_MAX = 500;        // max credit per network call (to prevent time-spoofing, not a daily cap)

// Daily video-watch time limit.
const DAILY_VIDEO_WATCH_HOURS_MAX = 5;
export const DAILY_VIDEO_WTC_MAX = Math.round(DAILY_VIDEO_WATCH_HOURS_MAX * 60 * VIDEO_WTC_PER_MINUTE); // = 500 WTC/day (auto-follows VIDEO_WTC_PER_MINUTE above)

// ── The Extract tab's ad-network buttons — each pays WTC directly ──
// adsgramSpecial re-added (was removed entirely per an earlier
// admin request; now back per a newer request). Different block ID this
// time (27566, daily limit 10) than the old one that was removed. USL Ads was removed entirely (admin request, 12 Oct 2026).
// See api/earn.js's handleAdStart/handleClaimAdReward, which check
// `enabled !== false` before allowing adStart/claimAdReward — kept in
// place so any network can be paused instantly by flipping its `enabled`
// flag here, without a code deploy.
// monetag reward 15 → 10 WTC (per admin request — Monetag's
// CPM runs low compared to the other networks, so the payout no longer
// matched what it was actually worth).
//
// AD_MIN_WATCH_SECONDS below used to be one shared floor for every network.
// Split into per-network `minWatchSeconds` here instead, since real ad unit
// durations differ network to network — a single shared number was always
// either too strict for the shortest network or too loose for the longest.
// AD_MIN_WATCH_SECONDS still exists as the fallback for any network that
// doesn't set its own minWatchSeconds (see handleClaimAdReward, api/earn.js).
//
// `requiresClick: true` (giga only now) — IMPORTANT — this flag is NOT yet
// enforced anywhere in api/earn.js. Implementing a real click requirement
// needs to be checked against what GigaPub's own SDK actually exposes
// (their simple rewarded-ad call doesn't appear to distinguish click vs.
// impression — only their separate, bigger "OfferWall" product does, which
// is a different integration entirely — see chat history). Flagging it here
// as a marker of INTENT so it isn't forgotten, not as something active.
//
// ⚠️ REMOVED (this update) — Monetag's server-to-server postback system
// (was handleMonetagPostback in api/earn.js, plus the ymid plumbing in
// index.html). Admin decision: reverted back to the same signed-token +
// timer heuristic every other network uses here, at a 6-second floor.
// `monetag` and `monetagPopup` are now ordinary networks again — no
// `requiresClick`, no postback, no ymid, no MONETAG_POSTBACK_SECRET needed.
// 22 Oct 2026 (admin): ALL ad networks removed. Empty on purpose - every ad action in api/earn.js answers 'invalid_network'.
export const AD_NETWORK_REWARDS = {};

// this export was MISSING, which is exactly why every /api/earn
// action (all 4 ad networks + video + tasks + promo, not just ads) was
// throwing a 500 today: api/earn.js imports this by name, and a missing
// named export fails the entire module's load, not just the one feature
// that uses it.
//
// Minimum seconds that must elapse between an `adStart` token being issued
// and `claimAdReward` accepting it — the server-side floor that makes the
// Termux replay-script attack impossible to instant-farm (it can still
// technically call claimAdReward after waiting this long with no ad
// actually watched, since this alone isn't full S2S ad-network
// verification — but it removes the "drain the daily limit in under a
// second" exploit, and rate-limits any adapted script to real wall-clock
// time).
// this is now only the FALLBACK for a network with no
// `minWatchSeconds` of its own in AD_NETWORK_REWARDS above (currently no
// network uses it, plus any future network added without an explicit
// value). Kept at 15s for that fallback case.
export const AD_MIN_WATCH_SECONDS = 15;

// with zero pacing. Now wired into handleClaimAdReward (see api/earn.js).
// lowered from 20s to 10s. NOTE: this was
// briefly paired with a temporary reward cut ("make each cycle worthless"
// instead of "make each cycle slow") — that reward cut has since been
// REVERTED per a later admin decision (rewards are back up, see
// AD_NETWORK_REWARDS above) once it was clear the real defense here is the
// time-gate itself (signed token + AD_MIN_WATCH_SECONDS + this cooldown),
// not the payout size. A script still can't complete an ad cycle faster
// than AD_MIN_WATCH_SECONDS + this cooldown regardless of what the reward
// is, so the two are no longer linked — reward size can move independently
// of this value going forward.

// is never blocked by their own honest usage; a script that skips straight
// from taskStart to taskComplete with no real wait gets rejected. See
// handleTaskStart/handleTaskComplete in api/earn.js.

export const TASK_MIN_WAIT_SECONDS = 4;

// cooldown between ANY two non-channel task completions by the same
// user, regardless of which task. TASK_MIN_WAIT_SECONDS above only limits how
// fast a SINGLE task can be claimed after it's started — it does nothing to
// stop a script from finishing task #1, then instantly taskStart→claim on
// task #2, #3, #4... in a chain, draining every open task in well under a
// minute. This mirrors AD_COOLDOWN_SECONDS (which already does exactly this
// for ad claims) but was missing here entirely. Deliberately NOT touching
// TASK_MIN_WAIT_SECONDS or the frontend's 5s countdown — those were a
// considered admin UX decision; this is a separate, additive gate that
// doesn't change how fast a real user's first task feels, only how fast
// they could chain many.
// was 15s (admin feedback: real users doing several tasks in a
// row would feel this as friction and drop off). Lowered to 8s — still long
// enough that a script can't drain a stack of tasks in the same handful of
// seconds it takes to be worth automating, but short enough that nobody
// genuinely browsing tasks back-to-back gets stopped waiting on it. This
// gate ONLY applies to non-channel tasks (see taskStartKey in
// handleTaskComplete, api/earn.js) — 'channel'/api-verified tasks (Telegram
// membership check) are never subject to this cooldown at all, exactly as
// requested: verification-based tasks stay instant, only the un-verifiable
